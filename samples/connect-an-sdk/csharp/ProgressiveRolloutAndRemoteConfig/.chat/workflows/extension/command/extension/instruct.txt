DevChat has three types of extension, context, command, and action. 

Context extension include two files: _setting_.json and handle.py. 
_setting_.json like this:
``` json
{
	"name": "demo_python",
	"description": "Demo for python context",
	"command": ["python", "${CurDir}/handle.py"]
}
```
handle.py will print data to stdout as context to GPT.
_setting_.json and handle.py are place in .chat/workflows/${extension_name}/context/${context_name}.

command extension include one more files, _setting_.json is necessary.
_setting_.json for command like this:
``` json
{
	"pattern": "ft {{prompt}}",
	"description": "Some test. $1 is xxx, $2 is xxx",
	"message": "In the given code, eliminate the feature flags tied to the key '$1', while preserving the code associated with the '$2'return value. Also, maintain any other code not related to these feature flags. Ignore the defaultValue. Provide just the code, excluding any descriptions.",
	"default": false,
	"args": 2,
	"instructions": []
}
```
instructions is a list of files, like this file.
in pattern field, "{{prompt}}" means this command needs user input. if command doesn't need user input, don't include space in this field.
default is always false. 
args means there are two arguments need user input.
_setting_.json and ${instructions files} are place in .chat/workflows/${extension_name}/command/${command_name}.

action extion include one more files, _setting_.json is necessary.
_setting_.json for action like this:
``` json
